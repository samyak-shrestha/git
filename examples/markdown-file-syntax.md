Example of a Markdown File for a Personal Website
Here's an example of a markdown file for a personal website, with image embedding, titles, paragraphs, and more:



### **Explanation of Markdown File Components**:
-   **Title (`#`)**: `# John Doe` creates the main title of the page.
-   **Image Embedding**: `![Profile Picture](https://example.com/profile.jpg)` embeds an image, like a profile picture or project screenshot.
-   **Text Styling**: `**Bold**` creates bold text for highlighting key information.
-   **Headings**: `##` creates subheadings like “About Me” or “Skills”.
-   **Lists**: `-` creates bullet points for listing items.
-   **Links**: `[Link Text](URL)` creates hyperlinks for contact or project URLs.
