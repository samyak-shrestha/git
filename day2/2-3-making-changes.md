# 2. Making Changes & Committing

## Editing Files

After cloning a repository and switching to your branch, you can edit files using your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code).

## Staging Changes

Before you can commit changes, you need to stage them. Staging lets you choose which changes to include in your next commit.

- Stage a specific file:
  ```sh
  git add filename.txt
  ```
- Stage all changed files:
  ```sh
  git add .
  ```

## Committing Changes

A commit saves your staged changes to the local repository. Always write a clear, descriptive commit message.

```sh
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

## Example Workflow

1. **Edit a file:**  
   Make your changes in the code editor.

2. **Stage the changes:**  
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit the changes:**  
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Add feature X or fix bug Y"
   ```

## Checking Status

You can check which files have changed and which are staged using:

```sh
git status
```
