## 2. Version Control and GitHub

###  1: Introduction to Version Control

- **What is Version Control?**

  - A system that helps track changes to files over time.

  - Enables collaboration on projects, even when people are working on the same file.

- **Why is it Important?**

  - Keeps a history of every change.

  - Helps you work on multiple features simultaneously.

  - Avoids overwriting each other‚Äôs work.

  - Useful for backups and recoveries.

###  2: What is Git?

- **Git** is a distributed version control system (VCS).

  - Tracks changes in files.

  - You can revert to previous versions.

  - It works locally, so you don‚Äôt need to be online to use Git.

- **How does Git Work?**

  - Git takes ‚Äúsnapshots‚Äù of files when you make a change.

  - Each snapshot is called a **commit**.
- Alternatives of Git
  - [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org)
  - [Subversion (also known as SVN)](https://subversion.apache.org/)
  - [CVS (Concurrent Versions System) ](https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/)

  - Helps you share code with others.

  - Allows team members to collaborate from anywhere.
