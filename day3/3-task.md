## 📝 Hands-On Exercise – Day 3: GitHub Pages & Portfolio

1. **Fork** the [simple-portfolio repository](https://github.com/samyak-shrestha/simple-portfolio) to your own GitHub account.
    - **Important:** When creating your fork, set the repository name as `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your actual GitHub username) if you want your portfolio to be published at `https://username.github.io`.
    - If you use any other repository name (e.g., `simple-portfolio`), your site will be published at `https://username.github.io/repo-name`.
    - **Example:**  
      - For repo `johnsmith.github.io`, your site will be at `https://johnsmith.github.io`
      - For repo `simple-portfolio`, your site will be at `https://johnsmith.github.io/simple-portfolio`

2. **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.

3. **Edit** the portfolio:
    - Update your name, bio, and contact information in the `index.html` and `README.md` file.
    - (Optional) Add a profile picture or custom styling.

4. **Commit** and **push** your changes to your forked repository.

5. **Enable GitHub Pages** for your repository:
    - Go to the repository’s Settings → Pages.
    - Set the source branch (usually `main`) and `/root` directory.
    - Save and wait for your site to be published.

6. **Share your GitHub Pages link** (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io` or `https://your-username.github.io/repo-name`) with your instructor or team.

7. **(Optional):**
    - Try using GitHub Desktop to make and push changes.
    - Explore writing in Markdown for formatting your content.
    - Add more sections or customize your portfolio further.
